# Manipulate Chroma Key Videos

By combining the capabilities of the video element with a canvas, you can now manipulate chroma-keying video (also known as the green screen effect).

Just add your video, select the most dominant color (normally green) with the color picker and play around with the RGB channels.

The more percentage you add the further you are from the original color picked.

**IMPORTANT:**

Still running some tests. But on the WEB version this is not working as expected. _Working on it_
Please use it for the moment on the [Desktop Native App](https://www.framer.com/desktop/).
